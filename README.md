# Move It - Moving Service Website

This project is my practice for building a website using Bootstrap 5.
I made a moving service site called **Move It** to learn how to create layouts, navigation bars, carousels, and footers.

In this project, I practiced:

- Making a responsive navbar with dropdown menus

- Designing a clean hero section with buttons and images

- Creating cards to show features of the service

- Adding an image carousel to display pictures

- Building a footer with contact info and useful links

I wanted to improve my HTML and Bootstrap skills by putting all these components together.
Itâ€™s a simple site but good for practicing frontend basics.

Just open the index.html file to see how it works:D !
